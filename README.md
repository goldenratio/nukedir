```

  <DIR_NAME>  Name of the directory that needs to deleted recursively

Options:
      --exclude-dir <EXCLUDE_DIR>  skip directories to match GLOB
      --max-depth <MAX_DEPTH>      Maximum directory depth to recurse into (inclusive) [default: 5]
  -h, --help                       Print help
  -V, --version                    Print version
```

nukedir node_modules
```

### Build

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Install

### Pre-built Binaries
Checkout releases for binaries, https://github.com/goldenratio/nukedir/releases


## Releasing nukedir

```
cargo release <VERSION LEVEL> --execute --no-publish
```

Where `<VERSION LEVEL>` is one of `major`, `minor`, or `patch`

Next you need to manually make the release in github from the tag. This will kick off the build process
to build all the releases assets and store them on the release in github.
